# This is my Practice Markdown Document (this line is a header due to the hash mark at the front)

## Headers 1 and 6 should be used sparingly apparently

## This section is on italics and bold text (this line is a header two due to the double hash mark at the front)

_enclosing underscores make text italic_

**double enclosing asterisks make text bold**

**you can make text bold _and_ italic.**  The order _**doesn't** matter._

### Headers _cannot_ be bolded, but they _can_ be _italicized_

### inline links

create inline hyperlinks by placing the text in brackets followed immediately by the url in parenthesis

[here is a link to google](www.google.com)

[this is a link to github](www.github.com)

here is a [link](https://github.com/cmordinibluhm) to my github profile

Make sure there isn't a space between your brackets and parenthesis
